• What design criteria must your project meet? What is the desired functionality?

• Describe the design you chose.

• What design choices did you make when you formulated your design? What trade-offs did you have to make?

• How do these design choices impact how well the project meets design criteria that would be encountered in a real engineering application, such as robustness, durability, and efficiency?

We set out to meet the following milestones as design criteria and desired functionality:

1. The robot should be able to reach each individual key position.
2. The robot should be able to traverse a trajectory consisting of a random sequence of 10 keys with randomized duration.
3. The robot should be able to play a single pre-planned note.
4. The robot should be able to play multiple pre-planned notes.
5. The robot should be able to generate accurate note sequences using the audio from notes played on the keyboard as input.
6. The robot should be able to replicate one note.
7. The robot should be able to replicate multiple notes.
8. The robot should be able to reconstruct a piano performance of no more than 60 seconds in length.
