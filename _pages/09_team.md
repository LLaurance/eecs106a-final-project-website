**Laurance Lau:** laurance.lau@~
I'm a fifth year Computer Science and Cognitive Science major. I had no prior robotics experience and little Arduino programming experience.
I wrote the signal processing portion of the code and provided debugging assistance wherever necessary.

**Derrick Ma:** derrickma@~
I’m a third year BioE major minoring in Linguistics, interested in prosthetic design. I have experience in mechanical design and CAD. I would like to continue working on projects that explore using robotics to perform human activities.
I designed and manufactured the hand component of Allegro. Iterated to fit changing project needs and contributed to video editing.

**Anuj Raichura:** anj27@~
I’m a third year Bioengineering major minoring in EECS, particularly interested in the applications of robotics to biomedical fields. I have been a part of various robotics teams for the last 6-7 years and have experience in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. In the future, I hope to apply the concepts I’ve learned in this class and through this project to work on medical robotics or electromechanical medical devices.
I wrote the path planning algorithm and stepper/servo actuation software, worked to integrate it with the signal processing code, and contributed to debugging electrical/hardware components.
