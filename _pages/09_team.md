**Colin Knizek:** knizek@~

Colin is a 4th year undergraduate Data Science major (minoring in EE/CS). They are interested in the intersection between neuroprosthetics and data science.

Colin's contributions include:
- The hardware implementation: including the linear rail actuation system, with corresponding wiring and mechanical components. 
- Sourcing a working piano system for the group.
- Performing hardware debugging. This involved diagnosing and resolving hardware-related issues, such as with the I2C/I2S communication protocols and interfacing the servos with the Wio Terminal.
- Creating the team Slack.

I am a fifth year Computer Science and Cognitive Science major. I had minimal robotics experience and little Arduino programming experience prior to this project.

I wrote the signal processing portion of the code, tailored conventional techniques for our purposes, and provided debugging assistance wherever necessary.

**Derrick Ma:** derrickma@~

I’m a third year BioE major minoring in Linguistics, interested in prosthetic design. I have experience in mechanical design and CAD. I would like to continue working on projects that explore using robotics to perform human activities.

I designed and manufactured the hand component of Allegro. Iterated to fit changing project needs and contributed to video editing.

**Anuj Raichura:** anj27@~

I’m a third year Bioengineering major minoring in EECS, particularly interested in the applications of robotics to biomedical fields. I have been a part of various robotics teams for the last 6-7 years and have experience in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. In the future, I hope to apply the concepts I’ve learned in this class and through this project to work on medical robotics or electromechanical medical devices.

I wrote the path planning algorithm and stepper/servo actuation software, worked to integrate it with the signal processing code, and contributed to debugging electrical/hardware components.
