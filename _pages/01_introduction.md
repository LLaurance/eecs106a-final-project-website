Our goal is to have our robot listen to a series of musical notes played by the user, then replicate the sequence itself on an electronic keyboard using an end effector resembling a hand. Our project is interesting because it involves imitating a human activity through a robotic arm. It requires expertise in and integration of diverse fields, including computer-aided design, 3D printing, and signal processing, to come to fruition.

Our project is a proof of concept that opens the possibility of more advanced robotic keyboard playing in this specific case and automated musical instrumentals and ensembles in general.
